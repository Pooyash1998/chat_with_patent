# chat_with_patent
A Streamlit app that allows users to interact with Google Patents data. By providing a Google Patents link, users can extract the patent number, download the associated patent PDF, and chat with an AI assistant (powered by OpenAi LLMs) about the patent's content. Users can also download the entire chat history as a PDF for reference.
